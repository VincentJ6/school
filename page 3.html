The fight took place mostly in and around Springfield. American Revolutionary War veteran Daniel Shays led  thousands rebels in a protest against economic. In 1787, Shays' rebels marched on the federal Springfield Armory in an unsuccessful attempt to seize its weaponry and overthrow the government. The confederal government found itself unable to finance troops to put down the rebellion, and it was consequently put down by the Massachusetts State militia and a privately funded local militia. The Articles of Confederation gave so little power to the federal power. When people saw that the federal power had way too little power and that the people were getting out of control. </div>
